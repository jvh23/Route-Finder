About Route-Finder****************************************************

Route-Finder finds the shortest route between any two buildings on the University of Washington campus.

About the main three src folders:*****************************************

graph folder - contains the graph ADT that designed to model map data.

route_finder - contains the main application.  The application is divided into two main parts: a model (RouteModel), and a view/controller (AdvancedGUI).  RouteModel models data.  It loads the data from the parser and is able to generate shortest routes using Dijkstra's Algorithm.  AdvancedGUI responds to user input and generates a GUI using Swing.

marvel - contains an application I wrote to help me test my graph model.

Other notes:**********************************************************
Pretty JavaDoc html for the application can be found in the doc folder.
